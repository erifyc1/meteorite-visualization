# Meteorite Visualization
# HackIllinois 2022

## Introduction:

Our project is a visualization of meteorite findings using multiple mediums and representations. With different perspectives on the visualization of this data, we hope to be able to draw new conclusions based on the patterns we find. </br>

## File Descriptions
1. [interactive_map.py](interactive_map.py): Interactive Heat Map with overlaid meteorite info. User can input time period to analyze and minimum mass of meteorite for plot points on map
2. [animation.ipynb](animation.ipynb): Animation of meteorites found over time, color and size of points scaled by mass
3. [misc_visualization.ipynb](misc_visualization.ipynb): Several basic visualizations
4. [metrics.ipynb](metrics.ipynb): Visualizations based on class of meteorite
5. [animation.html](images/animation.html): animation file output after running [animation.ipynb](animation.ipynb)
6. [map.html](map.html): animation file output after running [interactive_map.py](interactive_map.py)
